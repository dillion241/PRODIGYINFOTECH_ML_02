# Customer Segmentation with K-means Clustering

This repository contains a data science project focused on customer segmentation using the K-means clustering algorithm. The goal of this project is to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history, allowing businesses to tailor marketing strategies, promotions, and store layouts for different customer segments.

## Key Features

- Utilized the K-means clustering algorithm to group customers based on their "Annual Income" and "Spending Score."
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset and identify trends.
- Employed the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Visualized clusters and attributes using interactive Plotly bar plots.
- Incorporated Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and visualization.
- Derived actionable insights from the clusters to inform business decisions.

## Project Structure

- **data**: Contains the dataset used for customer segmentation.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter Notebook files detailing the step-by-step process of the project.
- **visualizations**: Visual representations of the clusters, attributes, and insights.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook
